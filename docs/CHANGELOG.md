### Changed

- `docs/bugs.md` — added OpenFEC rate limit limitation. Added RealClearPolling browser automation limitation. Updated wishlist with RealClearPolling (tertiary/reserve). Removed Polymarket (PredictIt not integrated).
- `README.md` — marked Task 3 ("Write Engine (polling)") as DONE in roadmap table.
- `docs/currentstate.md` — moved engine polling work into Built and checked off Phase 1 engine item.

### Resolved
- Verdict tag PASS styling: grey (#9CA3AF)
- WhatsApp message: "Done" only, no summary
- If 0 markets qualify: still show 3-5 briefs with full polling + analysis. Carlos decides, not Marcus.

### Added
- `state.py` — state read/write/upsert/transition helpers (Task 1 complete)
- `state/analysis.json` — empty schema file
- `collector.py` — Kalshi market discovery via public API (Task 2 complete)

## Rules

- Every meaningful change gets an entry. Small typo fixes don't.
- Format: `### Added/Changed/Fixed/Removed` under the relevant version header.
- If a change affects multiple areas, mention it once with context, don't repeat it.
- Breaking changes get a dedicated note.
