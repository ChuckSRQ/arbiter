# Current State

*Where the project is right now, the state machine, and the roadmap.*

---

## Status: Phase 1 Complete — MVP Running

Core pipeline complete. All 10 tasks done. Daily cron fires at 1:30PM ET.

---

## State Machine

Every market in `state/analysis.json` moves through states:

```
discovered → analyzing → complete
                         ↳ stale (if new polling data arrives)
```

| State | Meaning | Engine action |
|---|---|---|
| `discovered` | Market found by Collector, not yet analyzed | Move to `analyzing`, start research |
| `analyzing` | Marcus is working on it | Continue research, don't skip |
| `complete` | Brief written, market on report | Skip on next cron run |
| `stale` | Market was complete but new polling may change FV | Re-enter `analyzing` for delta recalculation |

**Market exits the pipeline at `complete` (or `stale`).** The report only shows `complete` markets.

## What's Built vs What's Planned

### Built
- `docs/agents.md` — agent roles, handoffs, brief specification
- `docs/README.md` — project overview and MVP scope (root)
- `docs/currentstate.md` — project state + state machine
- `docs/CHANGELOG.md` — change log
- `docs/bugs.md` — known limitations, resolved questions, pitfalls
- `docs/artifact-reference/artifact.html` — design spec
- `state.py` — state read/write/upsert/transition helpers
- `collector.py` — Kalshi market discovery (public API, rate-limited, 0.35s delay)
- `engine.py` — polling + financials analysis engine (VoteHub fetch, OpenFEC financials, FV heuristic, verdict, brief writing)
- `generator.py` — HTML report generator from complete market state
- `~/.hermes/scripts/arbiter-daily.py` — Hermes cron pipeline runner (collector → engine → generator, non-zero failure alerts)
- `state/analysis.json` — populated market state with completed briefs
- `output/index.html` — generated report output

### In Progress
- (all core tasks complete)

### Planned (not built)
- (no remaining MVP tasks)

### Post-MVP candidates
- Broader polling-source coverage beyond VoteHub/approval/generic ballot when reliable free sources are available

## MVP Roadmap

**Phase 1 — Core Pipeline (now)**
- [x] `state/analysis.json` — schema + `state.py` read/write/transition helpers
- [x] `collector.py` — public Kalshi API, pollable series filter, ≤60d window, rate-limited
- [x] `engine.py` — VoteHub API polling fetch + OpenFEC financials, FV calculation, verdict, full brief JSON
- [x] `generator.py` — index.html from brief JSON, artifact design
- [x] `output/index.html` — first generated report
- [x] First full pipeline run verified
- [x] WhatsApp "Done" ping

**Phase 2 — Localhost Cron**
- [x] Hermes cron job at 1:30PM ET (`arbiter-daily.py` via no_agent script, WhatsApp delivery)
- [x] Continuation logic (don't restart analysis from scratch)
- [x] Error handling with WhatsApp failure alert (non-zero exit triggers Hermes error notification)

**Stays Local (no deployment planned)**
- No Vercel, no GitHub Pages, no cloud hosting
- Arbiter runs on Carlos's machine via localhost

## Decisions Made

| Decision | Resolution |
|---|---|
| Stack | Python + static HTML. No Next.js/DB for MVP. |
| Cron | Hermes job `799f5a1b57ba`, `no_agent=true`, schedule `30 13 * * *`, script `~/.hermes/scripts/arbiter-daily.py` |
| Polling sources | VoteHub API (primary), Ballotpedia (secondary), RaceToTheWH, Wikipedia (mayorals), Quinnipiac/Siena (tertiary). Not locked to any single source. |
| Financial data | OpenFEC API — candidate receipts, disbursements, cash on hand, top donors, outside spend. DEMO_KEY works, no key required. |
| Market filter | ≤60 days from expiry, political/election only, has polling |
| Full briefs | Every qualifying market gets a full brief. No filtering by verdict. |
| Verdict tag | TRADE (amber) or PASS (grey) — on its own line below election date |
| Report minimum | Always show 3-5 political briefs per day. If fewer markets qualify, show what's available. Even PASS verdicts show full polling + analysis. Carlos decides, not Marcus. |
| WhatsApp ping | "Done" on completion — no summary, just confirmation |

## What's Still Open

- Wikipedia page URL structure for non-US elections (low priority, US-only for now)

All open questions go in `bugs.md` or get resolved before that phase is started.
